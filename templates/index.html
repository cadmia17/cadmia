      I am creating a trial paper generator for Maths Extension 1, called Cadmia. When I did the course accelerated last year, I struggled to find past and trial papers under the new syllabus, which impacted how I could prepare for my own trial and HSC exams. Cadmia aims to solve this problem by procedurally generating trial exams, allowing users to select the exam’s time, difficulty and not generate unlearned topics. This project is aimed to help all students taking the Mathematics Extension 1 course, which is about nine thousand every year.<br>
